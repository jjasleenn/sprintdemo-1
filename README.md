## Project Overview

StudyNest is a study planning web application that is aimed at assisting students to organize academic workload. Originally, the users will be able to make assignments and keep track of due dates and progress in their courses in a single location.
 
The project is aimed at illustrating component based architecture, user accessibility, and user-specific management data through the application of current front end technologies.

## How the Application Works
 
This stage offers the product's basic functionalities.<|human|>Present Functionality (Sprint 1) This step contains the fundamental functionality of the product.

In Sprint 1, the application is oriented on project preparation and system base, and not on complete interactivity. The application at this stage is:

- Framework- React, TypeScript, and Vite.

- Has a web-based Git workflow of secured branches and pull requests.

- Automatically deployed to production with Vercel.

- Renders React components of high-level that render static sample data.
 
The components determine the layout, structure and the pattern of accessibility that will be extended in subsequent sprints.

## Intended User Flow

After the complete implementation, a user will:

1. Log in to their account

2. See a customized interface with his or her assignments and deadlines.

3. Add, edit and delete assignments.

4. Should work to certain courses.

5. Status of assignment completion of tracks.
 
Every information presented in the application will be linked to the user who has been logged in.

## Project Scope and Breadth

The theme of Study Planner is purposefully too broad to restrict several pages and characteristics like:

- Assignment management

- Course organization

- Deadline and calendar views

- User profile and settings
 
Meanwhile, it is still centred on one domain enabling the team to add features gradually with no complexities unnecessarily.

## Why This Project Was Chosen

StudyNest has been selected as it is a real-life issue that will be encountered by students on a regular basis. This enables the team to invest in the application of course concepts like component design, accessibility and data flow instead of creating artificial use cases.
